## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Installation

**Option A: Using Conda (Recommended)**
```bash
# Create environment from file
conda env create -f environment.yml

# Activate environment
conda activate student_perf
```

**Option B: Using pip**
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate (Mac/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Train Models

```bash
# Train all 4 models and create weighted ensemble
python ensemble_model.py
```

This will:
- Train Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Network
- Calculate optimal ensemble weights based on validation performance
- Save all models to `models/` directory
- Generate performance comparison visualizations in `results/`

### 3. Generate Explainability Analysis

```bash
# Create SHAP feature importance visualizations
python model_explainer.py
```

This generates:
- Feature importance rankings for each model
- SHAP summary plots showing feature impacts
- Waterfall plots for individual predictions

### 4. Launch Interactive Dashboard

```bash
# Start Streamlit web application
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

Then open your browser to `http://localhost:8501`

## 📚 Dataset

- **Size**: 6,607 student records
- **Features**: 19 predictors including:
  - Academic: Hours studied, attendance, previous scores
  - Socio-economic: Family income, parental education, distance from home
  - Support: Tutoring sessions, teacher quality, internet access
  - Personal: Sleep hours, physical activity, learning disabilities
- **Target**: Exam score (0-100)

---

## 🔬 Methodology

### Ensemble Strategy

The weighted ensemble combines predictions using:

```
Ensemble Prediction = Σ (weight_i × prediction_i)
```

Where weights are calculated as:

```
weight_i = (1 / RMSE_i) / Σ(1 / RMSE_j)
```

This ensures better-performing models have more influence on the final prediction.

### Why Ensemble?

- **Reduced Overfitting**: Different models make different errors
- **Improved Accuracy**: Combines strengths of multiple approaches
- **Robustness**: Less sensitive to outliers and anomalies
- **Best Practice**: Used in winning solutions across ML competitions

## 📊 Usage Examples

### Making Predictions Programmatically

```python
from ensemble_model import StudentPerformanceEnsemble
import pandas as pd

# Load trained ensemble
ensemble = StudentPerformanceEnsemble()
ensemble.load_models()

# Prepare input (example values)
student_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Hours_Studied': [25],
    'Attendance': [90],
    'Parental_Involvement': [1],  # Encoded value
    # ... other features
})

# Get predictions from all models
predictions = ensemble.predict_all(student_data)

print(f"Ensemble Prediction: {predictions['Ensemble'][0]:.2f}")
print(f"XGBoost Prediction: {predictions['XGBoost'][0]:.2f}")
```

### Generating SHAP Explanations

```python
from model_explainer import ModelExplainer

# Create explainer
explainer = ModelExplainer(ensemble, X_train, X_test, feature_names)
explainer.create_explainers()
explainer.calculate_shap_values()

# Get feature importance
importance = explainer.get_feature_importance('XGBoost')
print(importance.head(10))

# Explain single prediction
explanation = explainer.explain_single_prediction('XGBoost', instance_idx=0)
```

```python
def build_xgboost(self):
    return xgb.XGBRegressor(
        n_estimators=500,      # Increase trees
        max_depth=8,           # Deeper trees
        learning_rate=0.05,    # Slower learning
        # ... other parameters
    )
